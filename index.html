                            <p>Information exchange is a crucial component of many realworld multi-agent systems. However, the communication between the agents involves two major challenges: the limited
                                bandwidth, and the shared communication medium between
                                the agents, which restricts the number of agents that can simultaneously exchange information. While both of these issues need to be addressed in practice, the impact of the latter problem on the performance of the multi-agent systems
                                has often been neglected. This becomes even more important
                                when the agents’ information or observations have different
                                importance, in which case the agents require different priorities for accessing the medium and sharing their information. In this work, we propose a distrbuted fair scheduling algorithm, called distributed self-clocked fair queueing (DSCFQ), to deal with this issue.  </p>

                            <p>End-to-end delay is a critical attribute of quality of service (QoS) in application domains such as cloud computing and
                                computer networks. This metric is particularly important in
                                tandem service systems, where the end-to-end service is provided through a chain of services. Service-rate control is a
                                common mechanism for providing QoS guarantees in service
                                systems. In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement learningbased (RL-based) service-rate controller that provides probabilistic upper-bounds on the end-to-end delay of the system, while preventing the overuse of service resources. In order to have a general framework, we use queueing theory to
                                model the service systems.</p>

                            <p>This article presents an analysis of a recently proposed queueing system model for energy storage with
discharge. Even without a load, energy storage systems experience a reduction of the stored energy through
self-discharge. In some storage technologies, the rate of self-discharge can exceed 50% of the stored energy
per day. We consider a queueing model, referred to as leakage queue, where, in addition to an arrival and a
service process, there is a leakage process that reduces the buffer content by a factor γ (0 < γ < 1) in each
time slot. When the average drift is positive, we discover that the leakage queue operates in one of two
regimes, each with distinct characteristics. In one of the regimes, the stored energy always stabilizes at a
point that lies below the storage capacity, and the stored energy closely follows a Gaussian distribution.
In the other regime, the storage system behaves similar to a conventional finite capacity system. For both
regimes, we derive expressions for the probabilities of underflow and overflow. In particular, we develop a
new martingale argument to estimate the probability of underflow in the second regime. The methods are
validated in a numerical example where the energy supply resembles a wind energy source.</p>

                            <p>Ensuring quality of service (QoS) guarantees in
                                service systems is a challenging task, particularly when the
                                system is composed of more fine-grained services, such as service
                                function chains. An important QoS metric in service systems is
                                the end-to-end delay, which becomes even more important in
                                delay-sensitive applications, where the jobs must be completed
                                within a time deadline. Admission control is one way of providing
                                end-to-end delay guarantee, where the controller accepts a job
                                only if it has a high probability of meeting the deadline. In
                                this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based admission
                                controller that guarantees a probabilistic upper-bound on the
                                end-to-end delay of the service system, while minimizes the
                                probability of unnecessary rejections. Our controller only uses
                                the queue length information of the network and requires no
                                knowledge about the network topology or system parameters.
                                Since long-term performance metrics are of great importance
                                in service systems, we take an average-reward reinforcement
                                learning approach, which is well suited to infinite horizon
                                problems. Our evaluations verify that the proposed RL-based
                                admission controller is capable of providing probabilistic bounds
                                on the end-to-end delay of the network, without using system
                                model information.</p>

                            <p>Ensuring the conformance of a service systems endto-end delay to service level agreement (SLA) constraints is a
                                challenging task that requires statistical measures beyond the
                                average delay. In this paper, we study the real-time prediction
                                of the end-to-end delay distribution in systems with composite
                                services such as service function chains. In order to have a general
                                framework, we use queueing theory to model service systems,
                                while also adopting a statistical learning approach to avoid the
                                limitations of queueing-theoretic methods such as stationarity
                                assumptions or other approximations that are often used to
                                make the analysis mathematically tractable. Specifically, we use
                                deep mixture density networks (MDN) to predict the end-to-end
                                distribution of the delay given the network’s state. As a result, our
                                method is sufficiently general to be applied in different contexts
                                and applications. Our evaluations show a good match between the
                                learned distributions and the simulations, which suggest that the
                                proposed method is a good candidate for providing probabilistic
                                bounds on the end-to-end delay of more complex systems where
                                simulations or theoretical methods are not applicable. </p>
